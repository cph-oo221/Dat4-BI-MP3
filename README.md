## Project Description

This project is the thrid mini project with focus on machine learning for prediction by regression. In this task we are using data (.csv) from property market in King County, USA. The primary goal is to training a regression model that can predict the prices of properties.

## Questions

- **What type/s of regression have you applied?**

  - Linear
  - Multiple linear
  - Linear with polynomial features

- **Which were the challenges?**

  xxx

- **How accurate is your solution?**

  After applying the three regression models: Linear, Multiple linear & Polynomial, can we conclude that the best result when trying these models are:

  Multiple linear regression (containing all slightly relevant features) with a $r^2$ of 55%.

- **What could be done for further improvement of the accuracy?**
